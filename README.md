# üìåBackground & Overview
## Objective:
üìñWhat is this project about?
This project aims to build a **PowerBi Dashboard** with four pages using the `Hotel Booking Dataset` which includes **booking-related data** (Confirmed Bookings, Pending, Cancelled Bookings), check-in & check-out dates. Additionally, it also has **service-related data** (service price, usage) and **room-related data** (price, room type, room number). The goal is to provde **Hotel Management Team** with data-driven insights to:
  - Understand the current business performance.
  - Identify the root cause of poor Occupancy Rate.
  - Evaluate room allocation & utilization efficiency.

ü•∑ Who is this project for ?
- Hotel Management Team
  
‚ùìBusiness Questions:
1. What is the hotel's current business performance?
2. Why is the Occupancy Rate below the industry benchmark?
3. Which rooms should be prioritized for improvement?
4. What is the optimal selling time for each room number?

# Data Processing by SQL & DAX 

1. Using SQL to detect [Data Anomalies](https://github.com/HuynhTanPhatT/Hotel-Data-Analysis-Occupancy-Room-Allocation-Optimization/blob/main/SQL/2_SQL%20-%20Identify%20Data%20Anomaly.sql)
    - Identify **booking cases** where the same room number has more than `2 bookings` on the same day => üö©Flag: Double Booking
    - Detect bookings with **Pending** or **Cancelled** status that still show service usage in the hotel => Update Booking Status
    - Identify cases where the second guest checks in before the first guest has checked out => üö©Flag: Double Booking

2. DAX Calculations & Formulas
  - `Employ some several DAX formulas to calculate Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)`:

- **Gross Revenue**:
```dax
Gross Revenue = 
VAR booking_revenue = 
CALCULATE(
    SUMX(booking_table,
    booking_table[price_per_night] * booking_table[stay_duration]))
VAR ancillary_revenue = 
CALCULATE(
    SUMX(detailed_service_usage_table,
    detailed_service_usage_table[price] * detailed_service_usage_table[quantity]))
RETURN

```dax

CALCULATE(
    COUNTROWS(booking_table),
    FILTER(booking_table,
    booking_table[booking_status] = "Cancelled" &&
    (booking_table[booking_flag] <> "Double Booking" || ISBLANK(booking_table[booking_flag]))))

# üìäKey Insights & Visualizations
## I. Overview
<img width="1301" height="730" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ef46418e-6ad0-4bf8-aeb1-45a10b73d9d7" />

- The fluctuation of metrics over the years is not large, but it is enough for us to evaluate the hotel's siatuation up to now, by comparing months that exceeded the two-year average.
- Firstly, the total number of bookings recorded from (02/2023 -> 02/2025) was **3.700** bookings:
    - Confirmed Bookings: **2.839 bookings** (76.37%)
    - Cancelled Bookings: **444 bookings** (12%)
    - Pending Bookings: **417 bookings** (11.27%)
1. **Booking Behavior**:
    - Customers' booking trends **leaned toward the mid-to-late months of the year** which exceeding the average (Jun,Jul, Sep,Oct,Dec) -> A growth trend focused on the high season (Summer, Winter and the period before Tet).

2. **Gross Revenue** & **Cancellations**:
    - Gross Revenue increased steadily over the years and reached **8.23M**, with stable months (Jun, July,Sep,Dec). However, **444 cancellations** caused (~901K) in revenue loss.
    - Net Revenue distribution by room type: Presidential ($1.182M), Deluxe($1.166M), Executive($1.090M), Suite($940K), Standard($900K)

3. **ADR** & **Occupancy Rate**:
    - ADR remained flat ($247-$300) -> indicating that the management did not adjust the pricing for room numbers to stimute sales.
    - Occupancy Rate (OR): (~14%), below the industry benchmark (60-70%), even with 200 available rooms.

=> **`Low OR is the root cause affecting other metrics: bookings, revenue,etc)`**.


## II. Occupancy Rate (%OR) Analysis
<img width="1299" height="727" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f6999b90-5f54-4f8d-bbde-7464fc73dd13" />

- The reasons for `"Why the Occupancy Rate low"` come from 3 factors: **Cancelled Room Nights**, **Sold Rooms**, and **ADR**.
1. Cancelled Room Nights: 2023 (1.599 cancellations) && 2024 (1.645 cancellations) -> This reflects the loss of potential sold rooms as well as revenue for the hotel.
  
2. Low Sold Rooms: 2023 (**8.674** room nights) && 2024 (**9.953** room nights)
   - Problem: the hotel has 200 room available per day (200 * 365 days == 73.00 room nights / year) -> The hotel is operating continuously with only 27 rooms to acount the number of sold rooms in 2023 || 2024.

3. ADR: The price ranges from ($51 - $500), but the performance of each room is poor across all the price segments -> Despite high/low ADR, it cant improve the %OR.

- **`Why did it happend`** ?
    - No demand stimulation actions: the hotel needs a collaborate from Sales / Marketing to increase the appeareance of the hotel and %OR.
    - Inefficient rooms: Room numbers consistently underperformed.
    - Inflexible pricing strategy: AD remained rigid overtime.

## III> Room Management | Room Allocation & Right-Selling Time
<img width="1302" height="723" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d5ecce06-602f-4290-8970-d50666f83f67" />



- The hotel operates 200 rooms per day, but allocation and selling-time utilization are ineffective.
    - Maintaining a large number of unsold rooms generates high fixed costs to keep them operational
    - Revenue loss from unoccupied rooms over two years and lost revenue from unoccupied rooms

- These inefficiencies come from three custom measures: **Unsold**, **Bad Performance**, **Potential Revenue Loss**.
    - **572** Unsold cases recorded over two years, resulting to **$65M** in `lost revenue from unoccupied rooms` -> (02/2023-02/2025) **Net Revenue** was only ~$7M compared to the ~$65M in potential revenue loss.
    - **1.547** cases of underperforming cases, where Occupancy Rate (%OR) were lower than the target.
    - Only **849** cases achieved good performance

- **`Why did it happen ?`**:
    - Poor seasonality-based allocation -> wrong timing for selling rooms
    - Large operation capacity (200 rooms/day) vs. actual.

=>üö© Hotel resources have remained underutilized for two consecutive years. As a result, strong revenue from booked rooms cannot offset this inefficiency, preventing the hotel from reaching desired profitability levels.
